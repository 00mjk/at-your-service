<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) spec generation on the frontend through a service worker proxy.

**Features**

- Generate a basic OpenAPI specification based on real requests/responses
- An extensible interface to generate types from responses for multiple language using [quicktype](https://github.com/quicktype/quicktype)
- **Experimental, it is a POC at this stage**

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

`at-your-service` features a CLI tool that places a service worker file into a directory. You likely wish to place this in `public` or `static`, as the service worker needs to be served from the root of your site.

Once this is installed, run the start script in your application code.

### Installation

1. Install NPM package
   ```sh
   npm install -D at-your-service@latest
   ```
2. Add service worker to `public`, `static`, or otherwise root directory
   ```sh
   npx at-your-service@latest <directory>
   ```
3. Run the start script in your application

   ```ts
   import { startAtYourService } from "at-your-service";

   startAtYourService();
   ```

4. Use your application, then click `Copy OpenAPI Spec` once sufficient requests have been dispatched to generate a specification with the information you are looking for

<!-- WHY -->

## Why

You may not have an OpenAPI specification to hand. OpenAPI specifications offer [powerful opportunities](https://openapi.tools/) that are worth making use of. OpenAPI 3.1 specifications are partially supported in [editor-next.swagger.io](https://editor-next.swagger.io/).

Some other envisioned benefits:

- **Convenience**: it's easy to load the service worker, run some requests, and copy the specification
- **Code gen**: there are opportunities for automatic code generation into multiple language on the FE from samples of responses
- **Investigation**: generate specifications from third party sites/applications, or see what requests were dispatched following a particular use of an application using a tool such as [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)
- **Dev tooling**: the tool could provide useful information about the network layer while developing an application

<!-- HOW -->

## How

The function `at-your-service` can be broken down into three steps:

**Setup**
- A service worker is installed at the root of your application `/at-your-service-sw.js`
- The function `startAtYourService()` starts the client in the application
  
**Operation**
- The service worker sends requests and responses to the application client. It acts as a proxy, intercepting requests and forwarding them on. This means that no work is required to integrate with application code
- The client collects information over time based on use of an application

**Query**
- At any point, information about this state can be queried. At present, the goal is to output an OAI 3.1 specification
- Given the data that is available, other potentially useful dev functionalities are possible, such as immediate codegen from responses into various languages
